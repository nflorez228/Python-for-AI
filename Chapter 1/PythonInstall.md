# Python Download and Installation Instructions
You may want to print these instructions before proceeding, so that you can refer to them while downloading and installing Python. Or, just keep this document in your browser. You should read each step completely before performing the action that it describes.

This document shows downloading and installing Python 3.8.2 on Windows 10 in March 2020. **You should download and install the latest version of Python.** 

## Python: Version 3.8.2
The Python download file requires about 25 Mb of disk space; keep it on your machine, in case you need to re-install Python. When installed, Python requires about an additional 90 Mb of disk space.

4. Move this file to a more permanent location, so that you can install Python (and reinstall it easily later, if necessary).
5. Feel free to explore this webpage further; if you want to just continue the installation, you can terminate the tab browsing this webpage.
6. Start the Installing instructions directly below.

### Installing
1. Double-click the icon labeling the file python-3.7.4-amd64.exe.
  A Python 3.8.2 (32-bit) Setup pop-up window will appear.

  Ensure that the Install launcher for all users (recommended) and the Add Python 3.8 to PATH checkboxes at the bottom are checked.

  If the Python Installer finds an earlier version of Python installed on your computer, the Install Now message may instead appear as Upgrade Now (and the checkboxes will not appear).

2. Highlight the Install Now (or Upgrade Now) message, and then click it.
  When run, a User Account Control pop-up window may appear on your screen. I could not capture its image, but it asks, Do you want to allow this app to make changes to your device.

3. Click the Yes button.
  A new Python 3.8.2 (32-bit) Setup pop-up window will appear with a Setup Progress message and a progress bar.

  During installation, it will show the various components it is installing and move the progress bar towards completion. Soon, a new Python 3.8.2 (32-bit) Setup pop-up window will appear with a Setup was successfuly message.

4. Click the Close button.
Python should now be installed.

### Verifying
To try to verify installation,
Navigate to the directory C:\Users\\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python37 (or to whatever directory Python was installed: see the pop-up window for Installing step 3).
Double-click the icon/file python.exe.
The following pop-up window will appear.



A pop-up window with the title C:\Users\Pattis\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python37\python.exe appears, and inside the window; on the first line is the text Python 3.7.4 ... (notice that it should also say 64 bit). Inside the window, at the bottom left, is the prompt >>>: type exit() to this prompt and press enter to terminate Python.

You should keep the file python-3.7.4.exe somewhere on your computer in case you need to reinstall Python (not likely necessary).

You may now follow the instructions to download and install Java (you should have already installed Java, but if you haven't, it is OK to do so now, so long as you install both Python and Java before you install Eclipse), and then follows the instruction to download and install the Eclipse IDE. Note: you need to download/install Java even if you are using Eclipse only for Python)
